# Java

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism in java happens automatically.  
```Java
Shape triangle = new Triangle()
```
Up-casting doesn't require explicit casting
`Shape` <- `Triangle` - up casting, more popular<br>
Down-casting require explicit casting
`Triangle` <- (Triangle)`Shape` - down casting<br>
